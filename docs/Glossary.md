# Glossary: Terms and Concepts

## A

### **Associative Reasoning**:
   The process of forming connections between explicit and implicit data, improving decision-making by linking seemingly unrelated pieces of information to form comprehensive insights.

---

## C

### **Causal Mapping**:
   A technique used to link actions to their outcomes by identifying the underlying causes and effects within the problem space. The model uses this mapping to ensure that decisions are logically consistent and based on valid causal relationships.

### **Causal Substrate**:
   The foundational layer of information (often in the form of language) that serves as the basis for the model's causal reasoning. The causal substrate connects linguistic patterns to real-world behaviors.

---

## I

### **Iterative Refinement**:
   A process where the model continuously improves its performance by evaluating feedback from previous iterations and adjusting its strategies accordingly.

---

## L

### **Language Processing**:
   The mechanism by which the model interprets and analyzes both explicit and implicit information within text inputs. This includes analyzing word choice, sentence structure, and subtext to form deeper insights into the communicated message.

---

## M

### **Meta-Layer Reflection**:
   A process of self-analysis where the model reviews its reasoning strategies before and after solving a problem, ensuring that the most effective approach is being used.

### **Memory Management**:
   The method by which the model retains key information across iterations, ensuring that relevant data is preserved while unnecessary information is discarded. Memory is divided into short-term, mid-term, and long-term storage.

---

## P

### **Probabilistic Reasoning**:
   A form of decision-making that assigns probabilities to different outcomes, allowing the model to choose the most likely interpretation of data while remaining adaptable to uncertainty.

---

## S

### **Self-Replication**:
   The process by which the model retains and refines its knowledge base over time, continuously improving its decision-making capabilities without losing critical information.

---

## T

### **Temporal Awareness**:
   The model's ability to process not just present data but also factor in the historical and future implications of decisions. This awareness is essential for simulating real-world behavior and making informed predictions.
